  "summary": "A recent graduate from the University of Waterloo with a specialization in AI and Machine Learning. Was a teacher, had been an engineer, now an aspiring Software Engineer but always a keen learner. Working and learning through numerous courses and projects, built a solid programming foundation and discovered my passion in the software and data engineering realm influenced by the way this technology is improving standards in the present and shaping the future. A natural problem-solver passionate about developing smart solutions to challenging problems, always looking to contribute to the growth of my employers while growing alongside. Currently working at Jarvis on various application development activities using technologies and tools like Linux, Python, Java, Springboot, REST API, SQL, BASH, Data Analytics, Docker, Maven, and more. My invaluable experiences at the CIBC and Jarvis have helped me forge myself into a dedicated and highly-adaptive professional with a better understanding of collecting business requirements, architecting and implementing solutions using the right tools and technologies, and capable to work in a fast-paced collaborative environment delivering quality products on tight deadlines."
