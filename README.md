**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KailashKhadka/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) system that manages a cluster of nodes running CentOS 7 and periodically monitors and logs hardware specification and data usage of each node in an RDBMS database. Created and used a VM instance in GCP and implemented in docker engine and PostgreSQL with bash scripting.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KailashKhadka/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Not Started
  - JDBC App: Not Started
  - Grep App: Implemented a Java application that searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and outputs matched lines to a file. This application implements a Java interface, uses libraries like java.io, java.util, and java.slf4j for logging. This project was written in Intellij IDEA with Maven project management and deployed on a docker engine.

## Highlighted Projects
**Feature Extraction and Classification on Fashion MNIST Image Dataset**: Conducted exploration, analysis, and classification of the dataset using traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches and compared performance and classification results.

**License Plate Detection and Recognition using Joint CNNs**: Implemented cascaded CNN model to detect license plate with high accuracy and fast speed followed by holistic CNN structure for recognition of detected license plates with an overall accuracy of 98% on CCPD parking dataset containing a wide variety of license plates; total 250k images

**R Shiny App for Exploration, Analysis, and Visualization of a Dataset**: Designed and developed a web-based interactive visualization application using R Shiny library to apply exploratory data analysis including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization and statistical tests.

**Minimum Vertex Cover for Street Camera Deployment**: Designed a multi-threaded Linux program using MINISAT solver library to solve minimum vertex cover problem to find locations such that a minimum number of street cameras could be installed to achieve full coverage of a network of roads.
